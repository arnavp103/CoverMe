**CoverMe is your best friend in all things job applications.**

CoverMe is a job application framework that aggregates job listings from apis and presents them to the user in a simple and intuitive manner.
The webapp is designed to be mobile friendly and pro-accessibility. It was birthed out of a two day hackathon, refined over weeks
of work, and built with love and fun.

One of the killer features of CoverMe is the ability to synthesize high-quality text from a user's resume
and the job description of the position they're applying for. This can be used to get a first draft of a cover letter,
or reach out with a personalized message to a recruiter on LinkedIn.
